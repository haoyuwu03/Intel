Stage 1: Finished on 7/5/2020

The objective of stage 1 was to create a simple yet comprehensive form to categorize diseases.

Successfully created a basic Neural Network that will be able to categorize types of diabetic rectinopathy images. (7/1)
Successfully added more types of diseases for the Neural Network to detect. (7/2)

Stage 2: Finished on 7/22/2020

The objective of stage 2 was to create a more complex classifier utilizing a residual network. We were able to achieve a 
training accuracy of 99.4% and a testing accuracy of 85%. In stage 2 we were able to categorize the following diseases: cataracts, 
glaucoma, and the stages of diabetic retinopathy. We plan to add hypertensive retinopathy as more data becomes available.

When using our stage 2 code, first put in images into the image_preprocessing.py
Then use the output and put the arrays into the resnet18_fundus_classifier.py
data_aug_expansion.py is only used to increase sample size for training.

Successfully created and tested the Res-Net 18 model. (7/16 -> 7/22)
